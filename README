Welcome to Mabuse, a simple and experimental game engine written in Java.

The current notion is to use jMonkey and Project Darkstar to build a muli-platform engine and toolset to create multiplayer, cooperative games.

It's also an experiment in distributed development.

I wouldn't have too many expectations, however, as this is very much a side project.
